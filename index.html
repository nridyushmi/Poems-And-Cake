	<p><strong>Poem #1</strong></p>
		<h5>Soulmates</h5>
		<p>I don't know how you are so familiar to me-<br>
			or why it feels less like I am getting to know you <br>
			and more as though I am remembering who you are. <br>
			How every smile, every whisper brings me closer <br>
			to the impossible conclusion that I have known you before, <br>
			I have loved you before-in another time, <br>
			a different place, <br>
			some other existence</p>
		<p>-Lang Leav</p>

	<p><strong>Poem #2</strong></p>
		<h5>An excerpt from the Bible</h5>
		<p>Love is patient, love is kind. <br>
			It does not envy, <br>
			it does not boast, <br>
			it is not proud. <br>
			<br>
			It does not dishonor others, <br>
			it is not self-seeking, <br>
			it is not easily angered, <br>
			it keeps no record of wrongs. <br>
			<br>
			Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. <br>
			It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. <br>
			Love never fails. <br>
			But where there are prophecies,<br>
			they will cease; where there are tongues, <br>
			they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, <br>
			it will pass away.<br>
			<br>
                <p>-Corinthians 13:4-8</p>

	<p><strong>Poem #3</strong></p>
                <h5>When You Come</h5>
		<p>When you come to me, unbidden, <br>
		Beckoning me <br>
		To long-ago rooms, <br>
		Where memories lie.<br>
		<br>
		
		Offering me, as to a child, an attic, <br>
		Gatherings of days too few. <br>
		Baubles of stolen kisses. <br>
		Trinkets of borrowed loves. <br>
		Trunks of secret words, <br>
		<br>
		I CRY.</p>
                <p>-Maya Angelou</p>
